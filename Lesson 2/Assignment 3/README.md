I have divided Problem 4 into 2 notebooks: 
1 - DNN-2-Hidden-Layers
2 - DNN-3, 4-Hidden-Layers

I got max accuracy of 96.1 % (but didn't record it by mistake) with 4 Hidden Layered network without tuning the hyper-parameters. I have max recorded accuracy of 95.8% with  3 Hidden Layered network. Would've gotten more if it wasn't for the lack of time
