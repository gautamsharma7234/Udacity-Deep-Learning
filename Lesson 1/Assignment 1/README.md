To sanitize the dataset (i.e to remove similar images: 
							1) within training set 
							2) between training set & validation set
							3) between training set & test set), the concept of locality-sensitive hashing is used in hashing part of the code

Cross-validation set (validation set) is used for hyperparameter tuning
