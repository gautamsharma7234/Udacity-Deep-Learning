This is only for Python 2.7 

First Activate Virtual Environment for TensorFlow:
	1) For Python 
	$ source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate

	2) For jupyter notebook (no need for this, you can directly choose virtual environment from jupyter notebook)
	$ source activate tf-env 


(tensorflow)$ # You prompt should change (see example of how your prompt will look):
(tensorflow) Gautams-MacBook-Air:Untitled gautamsharma$

Now you virtual environment is set and can your python code for tf

After you have finished using tf (at the end of the day):
(tensorflow)$ deactivate
